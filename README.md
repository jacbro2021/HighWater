This is a small SwiftUI application that makes use of apples CoreLocation and MapKit libraries to display the users location on a map. In addition to displaying location the application allows the user
to drop pins to indicate regions where there is flooding and warn other users. The application stores these flood locations using a firebase database and flood locations are dynamically updated in real time within the app as they are added.
